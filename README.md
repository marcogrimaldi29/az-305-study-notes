### ✅ Key Study Tips

- 🎯 The exam tests **"why this service?"** not just **"what does it do?"** — think in trade-offs and constraints
- 🔄 Know IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS boundaries — the exam tests blurry edge cases
- 💰 Know **SKU tier feature gates** — what Premium has that Standard doesn't matters a lot
- 📐 Study **Azure Architecture Center** reference architectures for real-world pattern fluency
- ⚡ Anchor every answer to the **Well-Architected Framework** pillars when in doubt
- 📊 Memorise **SLA uptime percentages** — scenario questions frequently test availability math
- 📖 For case studies: read **business requirements and constraints first**, then eliminate answers
